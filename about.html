      Drew don't know what to put here. The man is only able to play six
      stringed instruments; any more strings gives him a kiniption. SIX IS
      ENOUGH. Why do even need more? There's only twelve notes on the whole
      thing, what are you gonna do add another few? Ridiculous. Drew enjoys a
      good riff and a nice glass of single malt scotch. He also enjoys: sick
      delay units, a good fuzz, headbands, psychadelic garb, tapestries, a
      good rug to put his pedalboard on, band memes, gee-tars, jamming. Some of
      the musicians he enjoys: Zappa, Hendrix, Trey from Phish, Keef Richahds,
      da Beatles, PARK LIFE, various sad bois throughout late 90's to early 00's
      history, Stu.
